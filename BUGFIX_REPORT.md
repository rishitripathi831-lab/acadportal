# ROLE-BASED ROUTING BUG FIX - ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS & SOLUTION

## ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED ✓

The student login was redirecting to admin dashboard due to **localStorage role persistence issue**:

### Problem Chain:
1. **AdminLogin.jsx** stored role in localStorage: `localStorage.setItem('role', 'admin')`
2. **Login.jsx** (student/faculty) did NOT store role in localStorage
3. When a student logged in after an admin:
   - Student data stored in 'user' key ✓
   - But 'role' key still contained 'admin' from previous session ✗
4. **App.jsx** checked `localStorage.getItem('role')` FIRST
5. Found stale 'role': 'admin' → allowed access to admin dashboard ✗

### Incorrect Code Flow:
```
Student Login → Server sends role:'student' → 
localStorage['user'] = {role:'student'} ✓
BUT localStorage['role'] = 'admin' (from old session) ✗ →
App.jsx checks localStorage['role'] === 'admin' → TRUE ✗ →
Admin Dashboard allowed ✗
```

## FIXES APPLIED ✓

### 1. Login.jsx - Store role explicitly
**File**: `frontend/src/pages/Login.jsx`

**What was wrong:**
```jsx
// BEFORE: Only stored user object, not role
localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify(user));
// Missing: localStorage.setItem('role', user.role);
```

**Fixed to:**
```jsx
// AFTER: Store role explicitly
localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify(user));
localStorage.setItem('role', user.role); // NOW STORED!
console.log('Login successful:', user, 'role stored:', user.role);
```

**Why this fixes it:**
- Now when a student logs in, role is set to 'student'
- Overwrites any stale 'admin' role from previous session
- Consistent with AdminLogin.jsx behavior

---

### 2. App.jsx - Improved role checking logic
**File**: `frontend/src/App.jsx`

**What was wrong:**
```jsx
// BEFORE: Only had isAdmin() check
const isAdmin = () => {
  const roleFlag = localStorage.getItem('role');
  if (roleFlag) return roleFlag === 'admin';
  // ... fallback
};

// Faculty/Student routes had NO role guards
<Route path="/faculty-dashboard" element={<FacultyDashboard />} />  // NO GUARD!
<Route path="/student-dashboard" element={<StudentDashboard />} />  // NO GUARD!
```

**Fixed to:**
```jsx
// AFTER: Centralized role getter + separate checks for each role
const getCurrentRole = () => {
  // Returns: 'admin', 'faculty', 'student', or null
};

const isAdmin = () => getCurrentRole() === 'admin';
const isFaculty = () => getCurrentRole() === 'faculty';
const isStudent = () => getCurrentRole() === 'student';

// ALL routes now have proper guards
<Route path="/faculty-dashboard" element={isFaculty() ? <FacultyDashboard /> : <Navigate to="/login" replace />} />
<Route path="/student-dashboard" element={isStudent() ? <StudentDashboard /> : <Navigate to="/login" replace />} />
// ... all others
```

**Why this fixes it:**
- Each role type has explicit guard
- Student cannot access /faculty-dashboard (guard fails)
- Faculty cannot access /admin-dashboard (guard fails)
- Clear, maintainable code

---

### 3. App.jsx - Fixed DashboardLayout role parsing
**File**: `frontend/src/App.jsx` (lines 30-52)

**What was wrong:**
```jsx
// BEFORE: Buggy logic
user.role = parsedUser.role || parsedUser.role === 0 ? parsedUser.role : user.role;
// This line is confusing and may not set role correctly

if (!user.role || user.role === 'student') {
  // This checks if role is missing OR student, then overwrites it
}
```

**Fixed to:**
```jsx
// AFTER: Clear logic
user.role = parsedUser.role || user.role;

if (!user.role) {
  const roleFlag = localStorage.getItem('role');
  if (roleFlag) user.role = roleFlag;
}
```

**Why this fixes it:**
- Clear assignment without confusing ternary
- Only checks localStorage['role'] if user.role is missing
- Prevents accidental overwrites

---

### 4. Sidebar.jsx - Clear role on logout
**File**: `frontend/src/components/Sidebar.jsx`

**What was wrong:**
```jsx
// BEFORE: Only cleared user, not role
const handleLogout = () => {
  localStorage.removeItem('user');
  navigate('/login');
  // 'role' key still exists in localStorage!
};
```

**Fixed to:**
```jsx
// AFTER: Clear both user and role
const handleLogout = () => {
  localStorage.removeItem('user');
  localStorage.removeItem('role');  // ADDED
  navigate('/login');
};
```

**Why this fixes it:**
- Prevents new login from seeing stale role
- Clean slate for next user

---

### 5. TopNavbar.jsx - Clear role on logout
**File**: `frontend/src/components/TopNavbar.jsx`

Same fix as Sidebar.jsx - clear role on logout.

## VERIFICATION STEPS ✓

To verify the fix works:

### Test 1: Student Login Only
```
1. Open browser dev tools → Application → LocalStorage
2. Clear all keys (or use incognito window)
3. Go to /login
4. Select "Student" role
5. Login with: STU001 / password
   
Expected:
✓ localStorage['role'] = 'student'
✓ localStorage['user'] = {id:'STU001', name:'...', role:'student'}
✓ Redirects to /student-dashboard ONLY
✓ Can see student assignments
✓ Cannot access /faculty-dashboard (redirects to /login)
✓ Cannot access /admin-dashboard (redirects to /login)
```

### Test 2: Switch to Faculty (Logout First)
```
1. Click Logout in sidebar/navbar
2. Verify localStorage is cleared:
   ✓ localStorage['role'] is GONE
   ✓ localStorage['user'] is GONE
3. Login as Faculty: FAC001 / password

Expected:
✓ localStorage['role'] = 'faculty'
✓ localStorage['user'] = {id:'FAC001', name:'...', role:'faculty'}
✓ Redirects to /faculty-dashboard ONLY
✓ Can see faculty assignments
✓ Cannot access /student-dashboard (redirects to /login)
✓ Cannot access /admin-dashboard (redirects to /login)
```

### Test 3: Admin Login (Logout First)
```
1. Click Logout
2. Go to /admin/login
3. Login: admin / admin@123

Expected:
✓ localStorage['role'] = 'admin'
✓ localStorage['user'] = {id:'admin', name:'Administrator', role:'admin'}
✓ Redirects to /admin-dashboard ONLY
✓ Can see admin features
✓ Cannot access /student-dashboard (redirects to /login)
✓ Cannot access /faculty-dashboard (redirects to /login)
```

### Test 4: NO Logout Between Logins (Edge Case)
```
1. Login as Student → /student-dashboard
2. Manually navigate to /faculty-dashboard (without logout)

Expected:
✗ Should NOT show faculty dashboard
✓ Should redirect to /login (route guard catches wrong role)
```
